<br>Then click the "Write To File System" button above.
<br>This will export ALL of the pages and layouts to the file system.
<br>The import/export folder location is currently in the sites upload folder because it is read/writeable and starts with "ie-folder...".
<br>The folder name is random for each install but, it is no way secure. It of course is still web accessible if someone were to figure out the name.
<br>You will than be able to edit the files with your favorite text editor as needed.
<br>Once you are finished, you can import them ALL back into PyroCMS by selecting "Read From File System".
<br><br>
If people are interested I could create a inexpensively priced version which would have.
<br>The ability to import/export selected pages and/or layouts instead of all of them at once.
<br>The ability to import folders/pages/layouts/settings directly from the file system with no need to create them first.
<br>An UPLOAD ability which would add/modify pages and/or layouts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would allow you to add/modify layouts/pages like we add modules.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be great for a live systems. You could create the pages on a local dev. system, export them, zip the folder and then re-import them into your live system.
